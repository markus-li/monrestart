A simple set of bash files which can be executed from cron in order to restart a process/service based on simple criteria.

WARNING

Using this script to monitor your processes might be a VERY bad idea, see the following link for more information:

However, for my specific use-case, this is exactly what I need, so before you use this, make sure this will work in YOUR environment.

This script was written for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but might work as intended in other distributions/versions.
